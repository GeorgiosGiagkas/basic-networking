=== What is a network?

The goal of the network is to move information from one device to another. The sender and the reciever must _speak the same language_. That means that they have to agree how to communicate. This is called a *protocol*, a set of instructions on how to handle the information. 

.Protocol examples:
* TCP and ETHERNET are protocols for sending and recieving data.
* HTTP used for accessing the web
* SMTP used for email

.Quiz 1

.Quiz 3
====
How many protocols are used when one computer accesses another computer?
----
Several or many protocols

=== Network Types

Networks connect devices also known as nodes. Nodes can control the traffic of the network like switches or routers. Nodes can include end points or hosts, these are devices that send and recieve the bulk of the traffic (example servers, prints etc.).

==== SOHO network 

Small Office, Home Office.

WARNING: People often say hub but they mean switch when talking about a SOHO network. Hub is an old technology.

TIP: In a SOHO the router, switch and internet access point is integrated into one device.

==== LAN

Local Area Network with one or more switches and access points (SOHO vs Enterprise)

==== WAN

Wide area network connects networks that are foar apart


.Quiz 4
====
Your company has three divisions. Each group has a network, and all the networks are joined together. Is this still a LAN? Or is it something else?
----
LAN
----
====

.Quiz 5
====
The company adds a retail division. There is a head office and six branch offices. What type of network is this?
----
Each of the branch offices would also be called a LAN. ut, all of these networks are separated, so the whole network would be called a WAN

== Cabling Devices.footnote:[Cabling Devices :<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud8UeNgdaz4&list=PLDQaRcbiSnqF5U8ffMgZzS7fq1rHUI3Q8&index=2&ab_channel=NetworkDirection&t=1s>]




=== Cabling and WIFI

Fiber vs Coper

=== Ethernet protocol

The ethernet protocol describes physical links and how data is formatted.

Two layers(physical vs media Control Access)

802 = LAN technologies

.Ethernet physical standards:
* 802.3 = Ethernet
* 802.3i = 10 Mbps
* 802.3u = 100 Mbps
* 802.3ab = 1 Gbps
* 802.3an = 10 Gbps

TIP: Alternatively, 802.3an = 10GMBASE-T. 10G is for 10 Gagabits per seconds(speed). BASE is for baseband (cable), T for UTP (type of cable) or LX(optic cabe)

Electrical cables use electrical signals (compare to analog signal). PAttern of 01. 

UTP stands for Unshielded Twisted Pair and uses pairs of wires, twisted together. Some are for sending, others are for receiving.

Straight through UTP connects a host to a switch, and crossover UTP connects hosts to each other. However, modern ones support MDI-X whitch detects the cable type and adapts if needed.


Full duplex devices send and recieve at the same time. Half duplex takes turns sending and receiving.

=== Network addressing

In a LAN each device has two addresses. An IP address and a MAC address.

Each host has at least one *MAC address*, or more accurate, each network card has a *MAC address*. This address is permanent!

MAC address is used to for devices to communicate in the same LAN segment.

IP is chosen by us, the networking admins. Allows access hosts to a different LAN segment.
