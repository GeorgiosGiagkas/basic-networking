=== What is a network?

The goal of the network is to move information from one device to another. The sender and the reciever must _speak the same language_. That means that they have to agree how to communicate. This is called a *protocol*, a set of instructions on how to handle the information. 

.Protocol examples:
* TCP and ETHERNET are protocols for sending and recieving data.
* HTTP used for accessing the web
* SMTP used for email
